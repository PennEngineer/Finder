Finder App (Java)

This java application allows you to put in a US zipcode plus the type of venue you are looking for (ie Laundromat, Sushi, Groceries, etc) and it will return a list of venues closest to you. It will even show you the current temperature just in case you need to grab a jacket on your way out. Under the hood this project uses the FourSquare api to get the venue information and the OpenWeatherMap api to get the weather information.
